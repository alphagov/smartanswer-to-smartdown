- proof that you’ve been resident in the area covered by the embassy for at least 7 days, eg an employer’s letter or a bank statement
- your original passport and [full birth certificate](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate) or [naturalisation certificate](/get-replacement-citizenship-certificate)
- proof that you’re both over the age of 16, not within prohibited degrees of relationship to each other, and there’s no other impediment to your proposed marriage
- equivalent document for your partner[^13][^12][^10]

If either of you have been divorced, widowed or in a civil partnership before, you’ll also need:[^13][^12][^10]

- a [decree absolute or final order](/copy-decree-absolute-final-order), or
- the [death certificate](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate/)[^13][^12][^10]

###What happens next[^13][^12][^10]

Once you’ve submitted these and paid the registration fee (see below), the embassy or consulate will post your marriage notice publicly for 21 days.[^13][^12][^10]

As long as nobody has registered an objection after this time, the consular officer can then perform the marriage ceremony any time until 3 months after the date you gave notice.[^13][^12][^10]

You’ll need to pay additional fees for the marriage ceremony and to get your marriage certificate (see below).[^13][^12][^10]
##Naturalisation of your partner if they move to the UK[^14][^12][^10]

Your partner can apply to [become a British citizen](/becoming-a-british-citizen/if-your-spouse-is-a-british-citizen) once they've lived in the UK for 3 years.[^14][^12][^10]
