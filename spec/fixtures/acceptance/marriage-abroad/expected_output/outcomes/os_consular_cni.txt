They’ll then display your notice publicly for 21 days, and if nobody has raised an objection, they’ll issue your CNI. There’s an additional fee for this.[^90]

You can also pay the fee for your CNI in advance at your appointment, or send it in the post. Complete the [payment authorisation slip](/government/publications/passport-credit-debit-card-payment-authorisation-slip-japan) if you’re paying by Visa or MasterCard. If you’re paying by cash, use cash registered mail (‘Genkin Kakitome’).[^104]

Otherwise, you can make an appointment to collect your CNI in person:[^104]

- [Tokyo](https://britishembassytokyo.clickbook.net/sub/britishembassytokyo) (if you live in Eastern Japan)
- [Osaka](https://ukconsulateosaka.clickbook.net/sub/ukconsulateosaka) (if you live in Western Japan)[^104]
You’ll then have to email the embassy with completed [credit card authorisation](/government/publications/credit-card-authorisation-form), [couple information](/government/publications/couple-information-form) and [request for consular services](/government/publications/request-for-consular-services) forms to arrange payment so they can issue your Nulla Osta.[^105]

**British Embassy in Rome - marriages**
<rome.marriages@fco.gov.uk>
$C[^105]

They’ll contact you to arrange collection or delivery, and will normally aim to to issue the Nulla Osta within 20 days.[^105]
^Your partner will need to get their own CNI.^[^106]
^Your partner will need to follow the same process and pay the fees to get their own CNI.^[^107]
^Your partner will need to follow the same process to get their own Nulla Osta.^[^108]
^Chinese nationals can only be married in their area of 'household registration' (‘hukou’). If this is in a different consular district from where you give the notice, the CNI will be issued by the consulate-general or embassy covering that area.^[^109]
%The names on all documents you provide must appear exactly as they do on your passports - if not, the authorities may refuse to allow the marriage to go ahead. You may need to provide evidence if the name on your passport is different to your birth certificate (eg marriage certificate or deed poll).%[^110]
You should check if your CNI needs to be legalised (certified as genuine) by the local authorities in %{country_name_lowercase_prefix}.[^111]
###Other requirements for Belgium[^112]

There are several other documents you might need to get from the British Embassy if requested by the town hall, including:[^112]

- certificate of custom law (‘certificat de coutume’ / ‘attest van gewoonterecht’)
- certificate of nationality (‘certificat de nationalité’ ‘certificaat van nationaliteit’) - this can be a certified copy of your passport
- certificate of celibacy (‘certificat de celibat’ / ‘certificaat van celibaat’) - there’s no UK equivalent, but you can make a statutory declaration at the British embassy instead[^112]

Check with the town hall to find out if you need any of these documents. You’ll need to make an appointment at the embassy to get them. Bring any supporting documents they ask for, and pay a fee (see below).[^112]
[Book an appointment online](http://britishconsulate-gen.clickbook.net/).[^113][^112]
###Getting a marital status certificate[^12]

In some parts of Spain you may need to to get a ‘marital status certificate’ (‘certificado de estado civil’) instead of, or as well as, a CNI ('certificado de no impedimento').[^12]

Check with the [civil registry](http://www.mjusticia.gob.es/BUSCADIR/ServletControlador?apartado=buscadorGeneral&tipo=RC) where you’re getting married. If you need one, ask a [solicitor](/government/publications/spain-list-of-lawyers) (‘abogado’) to draw up a declaration for you printed on their headed paper.[^12]

^If it’s on blank, non-headed paper, they’ll need to give you a separate letter including their contact details, confirming that they’ve drawn up the declaration.^[^12]

You’ll then need to make an appointment at the consulate to make the declaration and sign the document in front of a consular officer - so don’t sign it beforehand.[^12]

Download instructions in English and Spanish on what the declaration needs to include.[^12]

You’ll also need a completed marital status certificate application form, as well as the supporting documents and the fee (see below). These are the same as the ones you need for a CNI.[^12]

Your partner will also need to get a marital status certificate from the consulate and pay the fees if the civil registry have told you that they need one.[^76][^12]
###Other requirements for Spain[^12]

The civil registrar may also ask for confirmation of your addresses for the past 2 years (‘confirmación de domicilio para casarse en España’).[^12]

You can get a [consular letter with proof of address for marriage](/notarial-and-documentary-services-guide-for-spain#proof-of-address-for-marriage) from the consulate if you need to provide this.[^12]
##Naturalisation of your partner if they move to the UK[^114]

Your partner can apply to [become a British citizen](/becoming-a-british-citizen/if-your-spouse-is-a-british-citizen) once they've lived in the UK for 3 years.[^114]
