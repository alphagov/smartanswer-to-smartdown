# PACS in %{country_name_lowercase_prefix}

%{country_name_lowercase_prefix} is an overseas department or territory of France. The rules and requirements for PACS there are similar to France.[^1]

Contact the 'tribunal d’instance' in the town where you’re entering into a PACS to find out about local laws, including what documents you’ll need.

If you’re not in France, [your closest French embassy](http://www.mfe.org/index.php/Annuaires/Ambassades-et-consulats-francais-a-l-etranger) may also be able to give you advice, or put you in touch with the relevant local authorities if you don’t know who to contact.

^You should [get legal advice](/government/organisations/foreign-commonwealth-office/series/list-of-lawyers) before making any plans.^

##What you need to do

You may be asked to provide a certificate of custom law (‘certificat de coutume’) if you’re entering into a PACS in .

You should check with the tribunal d’instance to find out if you need one.

If you need a certificate of custom law, you can get one from the [British Embassy in Paris](/government/world/organisations/british-embassy-paris).

Some tribunals only issue a certificate of custom less than 6 months before the date of your PACS. You should check with them before you apply. If your certificate is refused because you applied too early, you will need to apply and pay again.

###The certificate of celibacy
