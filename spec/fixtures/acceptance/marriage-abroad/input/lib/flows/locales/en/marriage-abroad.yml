          If you need a certificate to prove you’re allowed to marry, you’ll have to give notice of your intended marriage in the country where you live.

          Check with your nearest British high commission to find out if they can help you with this.

          ###Giving notice of marriage

          You’ll need to place a public announcement of your marriage in a local newspaper where you live for 1 week. If possible (and appropriate), this should be in English and the local language. It’s easier to do this in a weekly newspaper, as otherwise the announcement needs to appear for 7 consecutive days.

          You can use the example below as a template.


          $E
          I,………………………………...………………………(full name) single/widow(er)/divorcee,

          of ……………………………………………………………………………….…..(full address),

          intend to marry…………………...……… (full name of fiancee) single/widow(er)/divorcee,

          of …………………………………………………………….……………………..(full address),

          at …………….………(name and address of place where marriage has to be solemnised)

          on…………….….…..(date of proposed marriage).

          Any person knowing of any lawful impediment to the marriage should without delay notify:

          (High Commission address)
          $E

          You need to wait 21 days after placing the announcement to allow for any objections to be registered. You’ll then need to swear an oath or affidavit (written statement of facts) in front of a local solicitor or public notary stating that you’re free to marry.

          ^You’ll both need to place separate announcements and swear separate oaths if you’re both British nationals.^

          If you want the consulate to send your CNI in the post when it’s ready, take ¥700 worth of stamps to your appointment to give notice of marriage, or include payment for postage with your fee.

          You can also pay the fee for your CNI in advance at your appointment, or send it in the post. Complete the [payment authorisation slip](/government/publications/passport-credit-debit-card-payment-authorisation-slip-japan) if you’re paying by Visa or MasterCard. If you’re paying by cash, use cash registered mail (‘Genkin Kakitome’).

          Otherwise, you can make an appointment to collect your CNI in person:

          - [Tokyo](https://britishembassytokyo.clickbook.net/sub/britishembassytokyo) (if you live in Eastern Japan)
          - [Osaka](https://ukconsulateosaka.clickbook.net/sub/ukconsulateosaka) (if you live in Western Japan)

          There are several other documents you might need to get from the British Embassy if requested by the town hall, including:

          - certificate of custom law (‘certificat de coutume’ / ‘attest van gewoonterecht’)
          - certificate of nationality (‘certificat de nationalité’ ‘certificaat van nationaliteit’) - this can be a certified copy of your passport
          - certificate of celibacy (‘certificat de celibat’ / ‘certificaat van celibaat’) - there’s no UK equivalent, but you can make a statutory declaration at the British embassy instead

          Check with the town hall to find out if you need any of these documents. You’ll need to make an appointment at the embassy to get them. Bring any supporting documents they ask for, and pay a fee (see below).

          In some parts of Spain you may need to to get a ‘marital status certificate’ (‘certificado de estado civil’) instead of, or as well as, a CNI ('certificado de no impedimento').

          Check with the [civil registry](http://www.mjusticia.gob.es/BUSCADIR/ServletControlador?apartado=buscadorGeneral&tipo=RC) where you’re getting married. If you need one, ask a [solicitor](/government/publications/spain-list-of-lawyers) (‘abogado’) to draw up a declaration for you printed on their headed paper.

          ^If it’s on blank, non-headed paper, they’ll need to give you a separate letter including their contact details, confirming that they’ve drawn up the declaration.^

          You’ll then need to make an appointment at the consulate to make the declaration and sign the document in front of a consular officer - so don’t sign it beforehand.

          Download instructions in English and Spanish on what the declaration needs to include.

          - a notice of registration
          - a declaration that you and your partner will need to swear, stating that you’re legally entitled to enter into a civil partnership

          Once you’ve submitted these and paid the registration fee (see below), the embassy or consulate will display your notice publicly for 14 days.

          As long as nobody has registered an objection after this time, the registration officer can then register your partnership any time until 3 months after the date you gave notice.

          You’ll need to provide two witnesses and pay a fee to register your civil partnership. You’ll need to pay an additional fee for your civil partnership certificate (see below).

          Contact the local town hall (‘mairie’) where you’re getting married to find out about local laws, including what documents you’ll need.

          If you’re not in France, [your closest French embassy](http://www.mfe.org/index.php/Annuaires/Ambassades-et-consulats-francais-a-l-etranger) may also be able to give you advice, or put you in touch with the relevant local authorities if you don’t know who to contact.

          ^You should [get legal advice](/government/organisations/foreign-commonwealth-office/series/list-of-lawyers) before making any plans.^

          ##What you need to do

          You may be asked to provide a certificate of custom law (‘certificat de coutume’) if you’re getting married in %{country_name_lowercase_prefix}.

          You should check with the mairie in the town where you’re getting married to find out if you need one. Either you or your partner will need to have been legally resident there for at least 40 days before the ceremony.

          ^You’ll need to have a civil ceremony first if you’re getting married in a religious ceremony.^

          If you need a certificate of custom law, you can get one from the [British Embassy in Paris](/government/world/organisations/british-embassy-paris).

          Some mairies only issue a certificate of custom less than 6 months before the date of marriage. You should check with them before you apply. If your certificate is refused because you applied too early, you will need to apply and pay again.

          ###Applying for a certificate of custom law from the British Embassy

          s1. Download the [certificate of custom law application form](/government/publications/application-for-a-certificate-of-custom-law-for-marriage-france).
          s2. Make sure you’ve got all of the supporting documents you need - there’s a checklist on the form.
          s3. You’ll need to include a pre-paid self-addressed envelope and a registered letter slip (‘récépissé d’un envoi recommandé sans avis de réception’) with your name and address, or a €6.55 postage fee, if you want your documents to be returned.
          s4. Send your completed form to the British Embassy with your supporting documents and the correct fee. You’ll have to pay in Euros, as instructed on the payment slip attached to the form. See [consular fees for France](/government/publications/france-consular-fees) for the current fee.
          s5. The embassy will send your certificate and return your documents between 5 and 7 days after receiving your application.


          ###The certificate of celibacy

          The mairie might also ask you for a certificate of celibacy (‘certificat de célibat’) to prove you’re not married or in a civil partnership. There’s no equivalent to this document in British law, so you’ll need to download the official note which explains this and take it to the mairie instead.

          ###The certificate of celibacy

          The tribunal might also ask you for a certificate of celibacy (‘certificat de célibat’) to prove you’re not already married or in a civil partnership. It’s not possible to provide this under UK law, so you’ll need to download the explanatory note and take this to the tribunal instead.
